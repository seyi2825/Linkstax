   Each transaction is classified into categories relevant for tax purposes (e.g., income, capital gains, transfers).

4. **Tax Calculation Engine**
   The platform applies jurisdiction-specific tax rules to calculate real-time tax liabilities, factoring in cost basis, holding periods, and taxable events.

5. **Report Generation**
